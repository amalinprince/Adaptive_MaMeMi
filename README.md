#### MATLAB is used for the theoretical simulation study, Xilinx Vivado 2016.4 system edition is used for the hardware-software implementation.

##### The code and infrastructure can be used by developers and researchers to test many other methods as well.

## Guide to files in the repository

1. **AMaMeMi.m** --> This program simulates the AMaMeMi filter to process data in all the matfiles in the specified input directory. This program only returns the final result, in a 'result' folder within the input directory. If you wish to track the intermediate variables, please refer to the program titled 'AMaMeMi_expanded.m'
2. **AMaMeMi_expanded.m** --> This program simulates the AMaMeMi filter to process data in a single file. The user can load the value from a matfile or from a variable directly in the workspace.
3. **Single_file_AMaMeMi.m** --> % This program simulates the AMaMeMi filter to process data in a single file. The user can load the value from a matfile or from a variable directly in the workspace. This program only returns the final result, in a 'result' variable. If you wish to track the intermediate variables, please refer to the program titled 'AMaMeMi_expanded.m'
4. **SysGenRun.m** --> This program simulates the system generator file titled 'Filter_Basic' The input data for the hardware simulation comes from the folder Database. The output is stored in the matfile 'hwout.mat' and the 2-clock cycle delay is accounted for. PLEASE NOTE that you need to execute this code in Xilinx System Generator and not MATLAB.
5. **HW_impl/** --> This folder contains the files associated with the hardware implementation architecture.
     1. **hwcosim/** --> This folder contains the file **filterfpgadesign.xpr** which is the Xilinx Vivado project file for the hardware implementation.
     2. **ip/** --> This folder contains the *Intellectual Property (IP)* design of the accelerator which can be imported into a Xilinx project using the IP Configuration Wizard
     3. **System_Generator/** --> This folder contains the Simulink files for the architecture to be accessed and simulated using Xilinx System Generator.
          1. **Filter_Basic.slx** --> The basic hardware accelerator architecture that was implemented in the FPGA.
          2. **FilterFPGADesign.slx** --> The architecture used for simulation and verification of the design.
6. **Statiscal_Analysis/**
     1. **Freq_resp_gen.m** --> This program generates the frequency response for different valus of delta and sigma which changes according to iterations over the variables xfactor and yfactor.
     2. **RMSE_gen.m** --> This program generates the RMSE for the datasets used in the paper.
     3. **SNR_analysis.m** --> This program generates the SNR for the datasets used in this paper.
     4. **XCorr_gen.m** --> This program generates the cross correlation for the datasets used in the paper.
